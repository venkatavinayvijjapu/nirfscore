# NIRF Score Predictor using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) scores for colleges in India using Machine Learning techniques. The NIRF scores are an important benchmark for higher education institutions in India and are used to rank colleges and universities across the country.

Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
Pipenv
Jupyter Notebook (optional)
Required packages can be found in the requirements.txt file
Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

shell
Copy code
$ git clone https://github.com/[username]/nirf-score-predictor.git
$ cd nirf-score-predictor
Create a virtual environment with Pipenv and install the dependencies:

ruby
Copy code
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
Usage
The project includes two main files:

nirf_score_predictor.py: A script that contains the NIRFScorePredictor class, which can be used to generate predictions for NIRF scores.
nirf_score_predictor_notebook.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that walks through the process of using the NIRFScorePredictor class and provides some example predictions.
You can run the script from the command line by specifying the path to the input file (a CSV file containing the input features) and the path to the output file (a CSV file that will contain the predictions):

css
Copy code
$ python nirf_score_predictor.py --input_file path/to/inputs.csv --output_file path/to/outputs.csv
Alternatively, you can open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells to see the process and example predictions in action.

Data
The data used for training and evaluating the model is a sample of NIRF scores and relevant information for colleges in India. The data has been pre-processed and cleaned, and the input features have been selected based on the best performing features in previous studies.
